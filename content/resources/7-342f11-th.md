description: Shown above are 23 pairs of human chromosomes, with telomeres (protective
  DNA caps at the ends of the chromosomes) marked in white. In most human cells, telomeres
  become shorter with each cycle of DNA replication and cell division. The importance
  of telomere shortening to the process of cellular aging has been widely studied
  and debated. (Image by Hesed Padilla-Nash and Thomas Ried, the National Cancer Institute)
